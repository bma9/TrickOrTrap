First Floor - Main Room
You find yourself in the front foyer of a mansion. Examining the room, it’s old. As you inhale, your lungs fill with stagnant air, thick with dust and decay. You notice a flight of carpeted stairs covered partially with rust-colored stains. There’s also an antique carpet, a vanity mirror, and a doorway in front of you.

You’re only allowed to ask the duo one question.” You can see someone has written in pen “Which door would the other man recommend?” and below that the page seems to have responded with “The right door” You feel immense pressure to pick an answer, which do you choose?
